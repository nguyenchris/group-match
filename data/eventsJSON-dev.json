With his good looks, aristocratic connections, and money, he's never had to work and he's rarely slept alone. But all that changes when tragedy strikes and Maxim inherits his family's noble title, wealth, and estates, and all the responsibility that entails. It's a role he's not prepared for and one that he struggles to face.But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who's recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past.

It's a role he's not prepared for and one that he struggles to face.</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN>But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who's recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past. Reticent, beautiful, and musically gifted, she's an alluring mystery, and Maxim's longing for her deepens into a passion that he's never experienced and dares not name. Just who is Alessia Demachi? Can Maxim protect her from the malevolence that threatens her?

But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research.\nA unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan's \"mental travelogue\" is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives. \nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nMichael Pollan is the author of seven previous books, including Cooked, Food Rules, In Defense of Food, The Omnivore's Dilemma, and The Botany of Desire, all of which were New York Times bestsellers.

      "text": "JENNIFER THOMAS  || THE FIRE WITHIN TOURJennifer performs her epic music in intimate venues.July 11, 2019 - Stilwell Pianos - Ralph Stilwell Recital Hall, Mesa, AZ6:30pm Doors, 7:00 pm Show | Duration 2h Tickets $30 general seatingAll ages welcome\n\nVersatile and award-winning pianist, violinist, composer, and recording artist Jennifer Thomas makes her highly anticipated debut USA tour - featuring music primarily from her latest album, the critically acclaimed The Fire Within, which debuted #3 on Billboard Classical, and #2 on Billboard Classical Crossover. Thomas, an endorsed Yamaha artist, whose music is often described as being “cinematic” and “epic”, will perform on the piano, as well as some violin throughout the concert - backed by the high definition audio power of her orchestral tracks (recorded at Abbey Road Studios by the English Session Orchestra). The powerful tour de force of Jennifer’s captivating and emotionally charged music, combined with her open and real personal stories performed in these intimate venues will not only be an experience that fans will feel to their core, but one that will resonate in their hearts as well.\n\n \n\n“If you like brash, beautiful bold music that will light the musical fury from within, then yes “The Fire Within” is all that and more! Jennifer Thomas has simply added another brilliant recording to an already impressive discography that continues to shout out on the mountain tops the need for a complete full assault of major label support.  Yes, she is that impressive.”\n- Michael Debbage, music critic, mainlypiano.com\n\nABOUT JENNIFER THOMAS\n\nAward-winning American pianist, violinist, and composer, Jennifer Thomas performed as a soloist with symphonies and orchestras before striking out on her own as a successful recording artist in 2007. An endorsed Yamaha artist, Thomas’ original compositions and classical covers have found favor on the Billboard classical and classical crossover charts, and her music has been used in films, television, and sports. Thomas has also garnered almost a half billion streams on Pandora and Spotify.\nA native of Seattle, Washington, Thomas began her formal musical training at home at the age of five — her mother is also a pianist and composer. She studied piano at Brigham Young University-Idaho, where she performed with the school’s piano ensemble and played violin in its symphony. Upon graduating, the in-demand multi-instrumentalist performed with Salt Lake City’s Murray Symphony, the Temple Square Concert Series, and the Oregon Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra, and worked for the Seattle Symphony in their educational department. During this time Thomas began composing her own pieces, drawing on her deep knowledge of classical music to craft instrumental works that were both steeped in tradition, and experimental and cinematic.\nAdapting five classical pieces and debuting eight original compositions, she released her debut album, Key of Sea , in 2007. Two years later after the birth of her first son, she issued The Lullaby Album, a collaboration with her mother, Carolyn Southworth, that featured lullabies Southworth sang to Thomas as a child. The critically acclaimed and expansive Illumination arrived in 2012, and saw Thomas infusing her bold classical style with elements of world music.  She performed “Illumination” at Carnegie Hall in 2015, where she won “Best Piano Instrumental Album” for the EPR Radio Awards.\nHer Christmas-themed Winter Symphony arrived in 2015, and featured collaborations with musicians from the Ensign Chorus, the Utah Symphony , the Salt Lake City Pops Orchestra, and the Cochin Chamber Orchestra recorded at St. Edwards Cathedral at Bastyr University in the Seattle area. Thomas debuted this album’s music in a 2-night concert with the Ensign Symphony & Chorus at Benaroya Hall in Seattle.\nA remastered version of of her 2007 debut, Key of Sea, featuring bonus cuts and new artwork was issued in 2017 as Key of Sea - 10 Year Special Edition. In 2018 she signed with the Japanese record label, Avex Entertainment, in Japan and released a special Japanese version of Key of Sea - after her original song, “A Beautiful Storm” gained international attention as it was heard around the world in the free skate program of champion ice skater, Rika Kihira’s (winning the NHK Trophy, the 4 Continents, the World Grand Prix, and placing 4th in Worlds).\nIn late 2018, Thomas released The Fire Within, which debuted at #3 on the Billboard Classical, and #2 on Billboard Classical Crossover. The album was co-produced together with Swedish film composer, Glen Gabriel, and features the English Session Orchestra recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, as well as musicians from her long-time collaborator the Ensign Symphony. The critically acclaimed album also features renowned guest artists Eurielle, Tina Guo, and The Rogue Pianist.  In late summer 2018, Thomas returned to Benaroya Hall again as a guest soloist with the Ensign Symphony & Choir, debuting the music from The Fire Within.\nIn addition to Thomas’s 6 albums, she has also composed two film scores for the independent films Minuet (Ryan K. McNeal) (Won Best Film Score, Hollywood Music in Media Awards, and the Gold Medal of Excellence, Park City Music Film Festival), and Desert Rose (Alex Jones/Ryan K. McNeal)(nominated for Best Film Score, Hollywood Music in Media Awards). Thomas has also been featured as a guest artist on several other albums, including the Grammy Award nominated album Love Language by Wouter Kellerman.\nThomas is an active YouTuber and Patreon Creator, and has released multiple award-winning music videos for her music, as well as a plethora of vlogs, tutorials, and behind-the-scenes videos that showcase what it takes to produce her music and how she juggles life with her business partner/husband and three young children. Jennifer is a long time active member of The Recording Academy, the International Music and Entertainment Association, and the Alliance for Women Film Composers.\nThis is Jennifer’s first official solo tour and is excited to embark on this new ground.\n \n\n \nVENUE INFO:\nThe Ralph Stilwell Concert Hall was designed by Nathan Clelland (our store manager) to be a place where musicians love to play and listeners love to listen. The Hall is dedicated to the Stilwell patriarch Ralph Stilwell RPT who started our business in 1956. We are proud to bring such a high caliber performance hall to our local community! The hall seats about 134 people.\n\n\n\nFAQs \nAre there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?All ages welcome.  Please take young children out if they need attention. \nCan I talk to Jennifer and meet her at the concert?Jennifer will be available post-concert to sign CDs, posters, take photos and will try her best to get to as many people as possible.  We may add VIP meet & greet package later on that would involve more than this and will have more information on that later if it happens.  In that case, those interested would be able to upgrade their tickets if interested.\nHow can I contact the organizer with any questions?Please use the contact form on the organizer's event page. \nDo I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?You can bring your printed ticket, or your online confirmation. \nWhat are my parking options at the event?Free Parking is available at the Venue.\nWhat's the refund policy?All sales final.\nIs my ticket transferrable?Yes.
