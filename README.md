# Group Match

## Overview

Group-Match is a social networking web app where users can interact with each other within the real-time updated News Feed in order to post statuses, like other users' posts, comment on other users' posts, or edit their own comments. 

Users can search local events to determine if they would like to create a Meet Up based on their preferences where other users can then join the Meet Up.
